# Superstore_Sales_Project
In this project i have used SQL to analyze a real-world database,  extracted the most useful information from the dataset using Excel,  used a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database, and visualized the data using the PowerBI tool.
Step 1: Removed duplicate rows ( there could be duplicate rows excluding Row_ID column ).

Step 2: Removed rows for which few values are missing.

Step 3: Removed irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation of all values for a column( order date and ship date value must be in correct date format ). For each entry in dataset ship date >= order date

Step 5: After cleaning is done used the cleaned dataset to visualize the data using PowerBI.
